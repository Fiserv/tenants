# Infrequently Asked Questions

* How do I know if whether these docs or Teams messages are being written by AI or not?
  * Check to see whether they add reactions to your messages or send any emojis :)

* Is there a god?
  * Yes, his name is Nayan Patel (our Senior DevOps engineer)

* Why is there a nyan cat that flies across my screen sometimes?
  * You found one of our hidden Easter eggs! This can be triggered from our homepage. We hope you find it again!

* Will the DevStudio team have someone available on-call to respond to me if I'm lonely?
  * Yes! We have a 2-week on-call rotation but will be monitoring `General` and `Feedback and Help!` Teams channels so you may have different people to keep you company week-by-week.

* Why are there so many thumbs up emojis in some of these chats?
  * Usually they're commonly requested actions (like being added to a Github repo after getting removed for inactivity) so our team use the reaction to acknowledge handling it without spamming the same message. It also helps to not duplicate work if another person becomes the on-call support right afterwards.
