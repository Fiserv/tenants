# What is Gated Content?

"Gated Content" is a mechanism developed to control file visibility and permissions on Developer Studio. 

The different levels of accesses are:

**Public Access**: when the files are publicly accessible to all users.

**Private Access**: when the files are visible to a user only when registered and logged in Developer Studio.

**Private Entitled Access**: when the files are available only for those users who have specific accesses or entitlements for those files. This is the most protected level of access. To gain entitled file access user should become a member of the entitled group.
