# What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are dedicated spaces for developers to manage their Fiserv product integrations and projects. Each workspace may contain a different suite of self-service tools, outlined steps for integration, requirements and sharing permissions as set forth by the specific Fiserv product being integrated to. Developers can create a workspace for any supported Fiserv Product (not all products support workspaces or self-service functionality)

Although each workspace may have different requirements and tools, all workspaces will contain the same set of standard features with a consistent interface as outlined in this how-to guide.
