# Release Notes Validator

We at Developer Studio require all tenants to have release notes associated with every version of their APIs. This creates accountability and tracking for customers from all over the world to be able to trace changes and be up-to-date with their API usage in all scenarios, whether for prospective or current customers who may need to change their framework to the latest changes.

## Release Notes Checks

* Every `apiVersion` in `tenant.json` must have a release notes markdown file associated (name may vary)
* Release notes must preside in the `docs` folder

**Help:** Please connect with DevStudio team for more information and questions related with Validators via our Teams channel.
